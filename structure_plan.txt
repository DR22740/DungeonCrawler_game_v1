we need each item on a map be an object - a wall or a player. Wall has infinite HP but they can break! 
Player is a subclass of an entity class.


Mechanics:

Sanity
Sleeping checkpoints.

There are checkpoints of ORBs that allow you to rest and they repell evil.
If you do not set a checkpoint - your sanity decreases.
The lower the sanity the more mobs will be in each consecutive level.
When you reach insane - each mob gets unlimited damage. 
Sanity resets once you get back to your checkpoint.
